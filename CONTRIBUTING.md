## Developers Contribution 

#### If you want to add or fix some documentation then go ahead and edit the files below `functions` folder where the documentation exist (Adding files will auto-generate a new documentation - you can clone some already exist file in order to get the whole JS Object structure that describes the function). Otherwise, you're welcome to purpose any PRs to improve the code.
